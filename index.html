      Block-level elements ... most significant characteristic is that they typically are formatted with a line break before and after the element (thereby creating a stand-alone block of content). That is, they take up the width of their containers. (MDN HTML Reference)
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Block level elements take up 100% of the width of the parent container. (Unless a width is specified.) They can be assigned width, height, margin and padding. </p>
    
    <p>Block level elements are automatically placed on the next line after the previous block level element. This is the normal document flow when you don't use positioning or floats.</p>

    <h2>Inline Elments</h2>
    
    <p>Here are some inline elements: 
      <span>This is a span.</span>
    
      <em>This is emphasis.</em>
    
      <strong>This is strong.</strong>
      
      <a href="#">This is an anchor tag (link).</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>And here is an image: <img src="pumpkin.jpg" alt=""> which is also an inline element.</p>
    
    <p>
      <span> </span> 
      <em> </em> 
      <strong> </strong> 
      <a href=""> </a>
